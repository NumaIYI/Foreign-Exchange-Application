# Foreign-Exchange-Application
 interface for Foreign Exchange 
 
# Information for the project 
>#### The reason I don't convert this and similar projects to exe is so you can read my code.
- ### 1- First we need to install `python` .

- ### 2- We need to download the necessary libraries. You can do this by typing the following commands in the terminal.
  - #### `pip install PyQt5`

- ### 3- We open the `doviz.py` file with python then run file.

- ### 4- After running, the interface will appear. The program's text entries are listed in order, starting from the top left; The type of currency we will convert, the type of currency converted, and the amount.

- ### 5- Then we click the enter or click `Convert` button.
 
- ### 6- We will see the foreign currency equivalent and the total amount equivalent in units.
  
- ### 7-You can also find the currency type abbreviations and their equivalents in the currently converted currency below on the left.

- ### 8- If you have any problems, you can send me a message.
